**Experiment Setup:**
- Uses 2 large motors for wheels
- 1 medium motor for the grappler
- Ultrasonic sensor used to detect objects

**Program Description:**
1. The robot will initiate movement forward until it detects the cuboid.
2. Upon detection, it will grab the cuboid.
3. After grasping the cuboid, the robot will reverse its movement.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Limited capabilities of the sensor made locating the cuboid difficult.
- Only 1 ultrasonic sensor is available for detecting the cuboid, limiting the robot's ability to navigate around obstacles.
